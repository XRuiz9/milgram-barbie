# Milgram Barbie

This piece is called Milgram Barbie and is inspired by Barbie styling heads and the Milgram Shock Experiment. This was primarily an exploration into mechanical puppetry, but I was also wondering how the shock experiment changes when shifting the subject from human to inanimate object. Does the puppet's humanoid features evoke empathy and make us feel uneasy about torturing it? Or is it nothing more than cardboard and wires?

## Install It Yourself!

In order to replicate this device you'll need the following:

- A device with Arduino IDE installed on it
- An ESP32 Development Board and USB to Micro-USB Cable
- Two servo motors
- A switch
- A bread board and a number of wires
- Cardboard, chopsticks, paper, pipe cleaners, fabric, hot glue, and desperation

First what you'll want to do is clone this git repository. Then, with your ESP32 plugged into your laptop via Micro-USB, you'll want to open the puppet.ino and upload it to your ESP32. 

The code is actually quite simple, but the puppet mechanisms are harder to replicate.

For the eyes, you'll need to create a wire frame that goes inside the eyelids and attach it to a servo motor.

For the hands, you'll need to configure chopsticks into holes such that pressing down on them makes them pop up. You can use popsicle sticks to extend them and make a motor press down on them from farther away. Essentially what you are creating is a series of connected seesaws.

Create a cardboard body enclosure and hide all the wiring with fabric and you are set!
